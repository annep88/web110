	<h2>Site Planning Analysis</h2>
	<h3>Web Site Goal</h3>
		<p>The goal of my website would be to introduce my visitors to the country called Belarus. In the past few years the country
		has been becoming more popular among the tourists, and this web site would be a good resource for those who are planning
		a trip, whether it is for business or vacation. </p>
	<h3>Future content</h3>
		<dl>
		<dt>About</dt> 
			<dd> This page will not contain any information about the web site creator, but it will present some general information about the country
			like geographical location, demographics, basic history. </dd>
		<dt>Regions</dt>
			<dd>Belarus consists of 6 regions and each is unique in its own way. Business brings people to different parts of the counrty, so it would be 
			unfair to just focus on the capital of the country.</dd>
		<dt>Cuisine</dt>
			<dd>This page will talk about the gastronomical characteristics of the Belarusian cuisine.
			Belarusians are determined to promote national cuisine and preserve traditions of making and serving meals. This page will contain the names of the most 
			popular dishes and external links to their recipes. Also, as a bonus, this page will contain the names of the restaurants in the main Belarusian cities 
			that serve traditional meals.</dd>
		<dt>Must see</dt>
			<dd>Belarus is proud of its history and puts in a lot of effort to preserve it. It also played a huge role in WWII, so a lot of monuments and museums around
			the country are dedicated to the war. Beautiful castles and monuments all around Belarus are beautiful sights to see and explore.</dd>
		<dt>Do you speak..?</dt>
			<dd>This will be a phrasebook page that will contain different situations that tourists might find themselves in (checking into a hotel, getting around town, ordering meals, meeting people.
			This will be a helpful source for non-Russian speaking tourists.</dd>
		<dt>Feedback</dt>
		<dd>This page will contain forms for feedback submission. It will require their first name, email address, country of residence and any feedback as far as what content
		they would like to see on the website, if it's missing anything or contains errors or outdated information. </dd>
