	<h2>M4A - Focus on Web Design - Review a Site</h2>
	<h3>The Stitching corner</h3>
	<br>
	<dl>
		<dt>What is the company/organization?</dt>
		<dd> The website is an embroidery blog that follows the cross-stitching journey of the author.</dd>
		<dt>What is the URL?</dt>
		<dd><a href="https://stitchingcorner.com/" style="color:#FFFFFF; text-decoration-line: underline;">The Stitching Corner</a></dd>
		<dt>What is the purpose of the site?</dt>
		<dd>The purpose of the site is to share the progress on current projects and provide helpful tips for experienced stitchers and also those 
		who are interested in cross-stitching but are feeling overwhelmed and confused.</dd>
		<dt>Who is the intended audience?</dt>
		<dd> Intended audience is anyone interested in cross-stitching and embroidery as a hobby. Seeing someone else's progress can be motivational and 
		inspirational. Experienced stitchers appreciate not only the final result but the process itself; they love observing details in close up photographs, to see how a certain stitch 
		affects the final result and whether they will change something in the future when doing a similar project. Those who are just starting to stitch can find tutorials and simple patterns for 
		their first projects.</dd>
		<dt>Do you believe the site reaches its audience?</dt>
		<dd>The site does reach its audience, however it might not hold the audiences attention too much due to the nature 
		of the information presented on the main page. It involves too much scrolling down. It does have the links on the side to help "jump" to a certain date, however it does not eliminate the fact
		that the main page seems a bit overloaded.</dd>
		<dt>Was the site useful to you? Why or why not?</dt>
		<dd>The site was useful to me as I found some tutorials on techniques that I haven't tried yet. It also provided an
		insight on different kits and patterns and issues associated with their completion. It does not strive for the traffic seems like so it is not crowded with ads and links to external websites.
		</dd>
		<dt>List the colors and/or graphics that are used on the home page of this website, etc.</dt>
		<dd>The design is very consistent throughout the pages of the website.
		It uses the format of the white sheet on top of a brownish-red background. The top banner is consistent and represents the idea/subject of the site. The font colors are variable for 
		different links and headers (blue, green, pink). They are very mild, but sometimes too mild and light (as in h1) to where it is hard to read. The author used a variety of colors but they are 
		consistent with the color patterns represented on the banner of the webpage. Graphics are used within the content of the page and are not at all overwhelming. They are just the right size to
 		show the detail of the current project but not to overload the page. However, as mentioned earlier, the information on the main page could be compressed more in order to lower the amount of time 
		and data that it takes to load the page.</dd>
